            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Hi</p>
            <p>I'm Paulina, a second year student at the Uni of Edinburgh. I have always been very interested in
                technology and how it can be used to make the world a better place. I am currently studying
                Computer Science and I am hoping to go into software engineering after I graduate. I am also
                interested in the intersection between technology and the arts, and I am hoping to explore this
                more in the future.</p>
            <p>Also, my github copilot wrote this paragraph :D</p>
